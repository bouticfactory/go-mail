Email utilities including RFC5322 messages and Google Mail defaults.

This package is a merge between:
Erik Unger go-mail package github.com/ungerik/go-mail ed957872758630d680d012c923e445dd0a6b80bb
Scott Lawrence go-mail package github.com/bytbox/go-mail a6e25cbc346c474f58896ce882effdc4d9c386c1

bytbox's package contains go structures and a parser from raw arrays of bytes
to these structures. It is like a complete mail receiver.
ungerik's package contains simpler structures and a smtp configuration. It
is like a mail writer.

This package merges the two packages an adds:
- a "reverse-parser", that is a function to convert bytbox Message to a buffer
- more smtp flexibility to send HTML message

Be warned that it is a work in progress.
